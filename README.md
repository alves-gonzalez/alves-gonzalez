# Hi, Iâ€™m Alves Gonzalez â€” QA Engineer (Manual + Automation)

Postman â€¢ Cypress â€¢ Playwright â€¢ Selenium â€¢ Jasmine â€¢ SQL â€¢ HTML â€¢ CSS â€¢ JavaScript

Detail-oriented QA who writes clear test cases, logs reproducible bug reports, and builds reliable UI/API checks.  
I like turning chaos into calm releases. Always eager to keep learning, growing, and contributing to high-quality projects.
